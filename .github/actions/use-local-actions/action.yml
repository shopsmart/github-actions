name: 'Use local actions'
description: |
  Replaces `uses` within actions that use other actions within this repo.

  If we do not replace with local actions, we will end up using whatever
  version is tagged.  Currently, we are marking all internal actions with
  whatever the current major version is.  Though we can technically use
  multiple versions, we would like to avoid that.

  Example replacement:

  - uses: shopsmart/github-actions/actions/npm-setup@v1

  Replaced with

  - uses: ./actions/npm-setup

runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: 'Use local actions'
      shell: bash
      run: $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/use-local-actions.sh
